## PC Assemble
On Wednesday, November 6, 2024, a PC assembly activity took place in the laboratory on Level 3 of the N28 building. Students collaborated in groups of six, under the supervision of technicians who demonstrated the process of dismantling a PC. Following this, each group was assigned the task of reassembling the computer independently.
